Question 3:
===========

A.
Problem states:
NxN Board with the placement:

         | 2    Knight is placed
B(ij) =  | 1    Attacked position (no knights allowed)
         | 0    Empty position

Initial state:
Empty board, where for each i<=N, j<=N: B(i, j) = 0

Actions:
Place knight in an empty position

Transition model:
Place knight in an empty position (set position with 2) and recalculate the attacked positions due to the change (set
positions with 1)

Goal test:
All position are either with knights or attacked, where for each i<=N, j<=N: B(i, j) != 0

B.
A knight placed in a white cell will threaten only black cells and a knight placed in a black cell will threaten
only white cells. Therefore a board where all black cells have knight or a where all white cells have knight is a
valid setup.

When N is even there are (N^2)/2 white cells and (N^2)/2 black cells
When N is odd there are (N^2)/2 white cells and 1+(N^2)/2 black cells

Therefore there is always a setting of white or black cells that their number is ⎾(N^2)/2⏋, and on these cells the
knights will be placed.

    |-------------------|

On this 5x5 board configuration there are 8 knight. For this board, as shown in part B, we can place at least 13
knights, therefore this is not a global maximum state.
Movement of each single knight will put it in an attack state so this is a local maximum state.
